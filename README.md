# fastapi-authentication-system
A simple and secure authentication system built with FastAPI, featuring user signup, login, logout, and JWT-based token authentication. It integrates MongoDB for data storage and uses bcrypt for password hashing. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client, enabling secure access to protected routes. The logout functionality ensures that the user can invalidate their session by deleting the JWT token stored in cookies. This system provides a complete authentication flow, including account creation, secure login, and safe session management.
